### Glioma

**What is Glioma?**

 Glioma is a type of cancer that develops in the glial cells of the brain. Glial cells support the brainâ€™s nerve cells and keep them healthy. **Tumors are classified into grades I, II, III or IV based on standards set by the World Health Organization**. For this study, TCGA studied **<font color="red">lower grade glioma, which consists of grades II and III</font>**. Grade IV is a malignant glioma called Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most aggressive and most common primary brain tumor.

Regardless of grade, as a glioma tumor grows, **<font color="red">it compresses the normal brain tissue, frequently causing disabling or fatal effects.</font>** In 2010, more than 22,000 Americans were estimated to have been diagnosed and 13,140 were estimated to have died from brain and other nervous system cancers.

**Glioma may arise from different types of Glial cells**

- *Astrocyte* - transports nutrients and holds neurons in place
- *Oligodendrocyte* - provides insulation (myelin) to neurons
- *Microglia* - digests dead neurons and pathogens
- *Ependymal cells* - line the ventricles and secrete cerebrospinal fluid

"Figure (A) MRI FLAIR sequence showing a left frontal astrocytoma grade II located in a non-eloquent area with mainly cortical location, in a 38-year-old female. (B) MRI FLAIR sequence showing an insular oligodendroglioma grade II, located affecting cortical and subcortical regions, in a 27-year-old male."

### Data Description

This dataset contains brain MR images together with manual FLAIR abnormality segmentation masks.
The images were obtained from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA).

They correspond to **110 patients** included in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) lower-grade glioma collection with at least **<font color="red">fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)</font>** sequence and genomic cluster data available.


### File/Data Structure

Tumor genomic clusters and patient data is provided in `data.csv` file.

All images are provided in `.tif` format with 3 channels per image. For 101 cases, 3 sequences are available, i.e. pre-contrast, FLAIR, post-contrast (in this order of channels).

For 9 cases, post-contrast sequence is missing and for 6 cases, pre-contrast sequence is missing.
**Missing sequences are replaced with FLAIR sequence to make all images 3-channel.**

**<font color="red">Masks</font>** are binary, 1-channel images. They **segment FLAIR abnormality present in the FLAIR sequence** (available for all cases).

The dataset is organized into 110 folders named after case ID that contains information about source institution. Each folder contains MR images with the following naming convention:

`TCGA_<institution-code>_<patient-id>_<slice-number>.tif`

Corresponding masks have a `_mask` suffix.

### Task

1. The link to the data was sent to you by a person from my lab on Duke Box

2. Your task is to predict two labels:
    - **<font color="red">COCCluster</font>**
    - **<font color="red">neoplasm_histologic_grade</font>**

3. You should do a **<font color="red">10-fold crossvalidation</font>** and report pooling and averaging performance of your best model as well as some models that did not work as well

4. Report performance in terms of area under the **<font color="red">ROC</font>**. For the problem that is **multi-class show 1 class vs. all other classes** performance for all the classes.

5. Explain your final model including how you trained it, did you **normalize and augment** the data etc.

6. Explain which aspects of your model improved performance and why you think that is

7. **Present in PowerPoint**, about 10 minutes per person + questions
